# Introduction
In an asynchronous FIFO, the read and write operations run on different clock frequencies. Because the write and read clocks are not synchronized, the FIFO is termed “asynchronous.” 
It is commonly used for transferring data between two different clock domains, a process known as clock domain crossing (CDC). 
This allows smooth synchronization of data flow between systems operating on independent clocks.
